    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
    Hi, I'm Lewis, currently completeing my final year at university and looking towards future employment. 
    I've been tinkering with programming and software from about 13 years of age, where I wrote my first few Visual Basic scripts. 
    From there I found employment as a junior software developer at 18.
    After two years working as a developer on bespoke plug-in solutions for CRM software, I moved on to studying computer science to broaden my horizons.

    <h1>Course studies</h1>
    <p class="am_paraRight">
    University has provided me the oppurtunity to explore a wide range of sectors through a number of projects (displayed <a href="/Projects">here</a>).
    Topics covered throughout university have touched upon a number of areas such as machine learning, web development and cyber security; 
    as well as low-level topics such as operating systems and computer arhitecture.
    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout university, I have predominantly worked with C++ and Python, but have also had the oppurtunity to work with Matlab, R, Javascript and Assembly. 
    Exposure to a wide range of languages has helped me appreciate the need for a specific tool in solving a specific job.
    </p>

    <h1>Previous employment</h1>
    <p class="am_paraRight">
    Previous to my studies, I worked as a junior software developer. Initially this job was secured through a year long apprenticeship, prior to which, 
    I had no formal computer science education, having been completely self-taught. My time spent in professional software development pushed me towards
    industry standard practices such as version control of source code and agile development methodologies. 
    These personal advancements greatly improved the quality and robustness of my work.
    <br>
    <br>
    During my employment, I developed bespoke plug-ins for calculating cost and pricing of industry-specific jobs. 
    These plug-ins were developed in Pascal, and were targetted towards a number of industries. 
    Work included development of specifications and liasing with clients, as well as on-site visits to develop an understanding of industry practices.

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    <p class="am_paraRight">
    Alongside computer science, a large personal hobby is music, which considerably expanded through the duration of my university studies.
    Through membership of the music society, I was able to not only improve my musical skill, but also develop personally; 
    Engaging in a wide range of social activity that greatly bolstered my confidence and character.
    <br>
    <br>
    Engagement in socials, performances at open mic nights, and taking a leadership role as treasurer were all milestones and personal challenges
    which were overcome, greatly affecting who I am today.
